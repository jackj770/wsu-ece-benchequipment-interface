A toolset for controlling and automating benchtop equipment for electronics testing. Built for ECE 5900 Digital Signal Processing Capstone Project. 


## Description 

Gathering data from benchtop equiopment can be a very tedious task espicially with any real precesion or resoltuion. For example, gathering frequency response data is painful when gathering more than a few data points over a few frequency steps. This toolset aims to make all these tasks easier by automating the process using standard benchtop equipment commands and PyVISA.
